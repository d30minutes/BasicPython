##Code a function to sum all the numbers in a list.
	Hint: Use for loop to traverse the list and find a sum in a new variable.
##Code a function to find the max of three numbers.
    Hint: Use for loop to traverse the list and use a variable to contain the max number.
##Code a function to multiply all the numbers in a list (Try to use while loop here for practice).
    Hint: Traverse the while loop till size of the list, use an index variable initialize it before while loop as 0.
##Write a Python program to reverse a string.
    Hint: Loop the string starting from the last index.

##Code a function to calculate the factorial of a number (a non-negative integer). The function accepts the number as an argument.
    Hint: Use for loop and use the provided number as a range.
##Code a function to find whether the given number falls in a given range. 
	Hint: Use greater than and less than arithmetic operators.
##Code a function that accepts a string and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.
    Hint: isupper() and islower() functions of a string can help in this exercise.
##Code a function that takes a list and returns a new list with unique elements of the first list.
    Hint: recall the module where we studied about Set datatype.

##Code a function that takes a number as a parameter and check the number is prime or not.
    Hint: A prime number is a number greater than 1 and that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
##Code a function to print the even numbers from a given list. 
    Hint: modulus (%) operator can surely help here.
##Code a function to execute a string containing Python code.
    Hint: Try using exec(object[,globals[,locals]]) function available in python. For further details on exec function please visit https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/functions.html#exec 
##Code a function that invoke a given function after specific milliseconds. 
    Hint: There is a method called sleep(seconds) is available in the module time. (we have already studied how to import modules)
